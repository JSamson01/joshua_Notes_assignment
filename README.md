PROJECT NAME: Joshua Notes Assignment
LANGUAGE USED: Java programming language
DEVELOPMENT TOOLS: Android Studio, SDK, Emulator and an updated gridle
PROJECT LIBRARIES: Lifecycle Management And Data Persistence among others

PROJECT IDEA:
-	The project idea is to design and develop a mobile application an app using Architecture Components such as Room, ViewModel, and LiveData.
-	This mobile app is expected to do the following:

a)	Implements our recommended architecture using the Android Architecture Components.
b)	Works with a database to get and save the data and pre-populates the database with some words.
c)	Displays all the words in a RecyclerView in MainActivity.
d)	Opens a second activity when the user taps the + button. When the user enters a word, adds the word to the database and the list.
The app is no-frills, but sufficiently complex that you can use it as a template to build upon
